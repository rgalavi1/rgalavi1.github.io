                    <ul>
                        <li>C:The opacity of the homepage image is balanced with the white text. The white text throughout the page is also balanced with the white backgorund.</li>
                        <li>R:The font size and style throughout the page is consistant. The bold and big text repeats to establish key points in the page. The smaller text is also consistant.</li>
                        <li>A:There is alignment with the pictures and description of the pictures.</li>
                        <li>P:Spacing between elements helps the user navigate the page. Products and their descriptions are grouped together. </li>

            <h3><a class = "link" href="https://www.lingscars.com/">LingsCars</a></h3>
                <p>LingsCar is a car leasing company in the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>C:There is no balance of color throughout the page. The contrast does not help visibility and makes it harder to read.</li>
                        <li>R:There is no repetition in the font styles and sizes. It is hard to understand what the key points are for the user.</li>
                        <li>A:Elements look like they were blindly slapped on the page. There is no consistant alignment with graphics and text.</li>
                        <li>P:There is no space between elements to let the user know that they are not related.</li>
