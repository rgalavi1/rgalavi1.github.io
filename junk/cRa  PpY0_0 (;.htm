<h3 style= "font-family: Comic Sans MS; color:black;">When people talk they talk really fast. But when they speak they speak non-stop and makes the other person want to rip their ears off. When someone works at a store and says they are stockers it sounds like they're saying stalkers. Makes you wonder what they actually meant.</h3>

        <h1 style= "font-size: 100px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center;">There used to be a van parked down by river. The river took the van with it and never returned it. That's terrible for the van owners as they were still paying off the van. At the same time parking a van by the river is kind of irresponsible, so in my opinion the van owners just wanted an insurance claim. When you're at the airport and have no choice but to stand while you wait to board, people ARE staring at you. If you see a service animal don't pet it, actually don't even look at it.</h1>
