            <img src="images/ford-convertible.jpg" style="width: 30pc; height: 20pc;">
            <h4>$39,900</h4>
            <p>The car would be considered a driver the body is in near perfect condition no rust to speak of. The paint still has a good shine to it. The motor had just been rebuilt a few thousand miles ago and runs perfect. The chrome and stainless does have some pitting but is in good condition. The car has automatic transmission and works flawlessly. The top is black and has it recently been replaced about two years ago. The interior of the car is red black and white and it’s still the original interior that came with the car. If a person wanted to do a total restoration on this car this would be the one to do it on because the body is in such good shape as I say right now it’s a driver not a show car what a beautiful car.</p>
