                Reviving Goat Inc was founded by Daniel Terminator. As a young boy Daniel always wanted a goat. He would see various goats on his walk to school, which would be miles of 
                hiking. As he became older his love for goats grew until finally he was able to afford and own his own goat. His company dedicates their efforts to providing less fortunate 
                goat enthusiastic children the ability to adopt their own goat. No goat is too far because Reviving Goat Inc. ships goats worldwide and will make sure each child gets their
                own goat. A smile is guaranteed.
